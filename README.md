**Remote Access**

The main objective of remote access mobile application is to access a mobile phone running on android OS remotely through another mobile phone. The app comes handy when a particular mobile is cannot be found and the mobile is in silent mode; we remotely access the lost mobile using the app and change the silent mode to general mode so that when the user calls with the help of the ringtone we can locate the mobile phone.
